# Money Transfer Financial Platform

Welcome to the Money Transfer Financial Platform, a solution for all your currency exchange and money transfer needs. This platform is designed to simplify the process of sending money across borders while providing real-time exchange rate information, ensuring that both senders and recipients have full visibility into the transaction.

This platfrom offers a range of services: 
- **Currency Conversion:** Using exchange rates, this code enables users to convert a certain sum between different currencies. The user can choose the country of destination then enter the desired amount ("You Send"), and see the desired currency ("They Receive"). The amount the recipient will receive is determined by the code using currency rates, and it is displayed in the "They Receive" input area.

- **Various payment options:** such as bank deposit, mobile money via an app, and cash withdrawal for delivery methods.

- **FeeÂ Calculation:** A fee is computed by the code based on the amount and selected currency that the user wishes to transmit. The chosen currency (for example, EUR, USD, BIF, or RWF) determines the fee percentage. The charge amount is shown to the user as a percentage of the "You Send" amount as well as a numeric value.

- **Real-time Updates:** As the user enters data into the input fields, the code updates in real-time. For instance, the "They Receive" amount, fee, and total amount are all instantly recalculated and displayed whenever the user modifies the "You Send" amount or chooses a different currency.

- **User Interface Interactions:** The code contains event listeners for a variety of user activities, such as clearing the "You Send" field by clicking on it, confirming the user's selection of a destination nation, and updating the UI when the user modifies the available currencies.
